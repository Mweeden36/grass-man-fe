  "blurb": "Thank you for visiting The Grass Man's website! Marc Horne, locally raised, learned the skills of property care at an early age. He would pick up sticks, clear out flower boxes and observe how his grandmother would care for her home with love and precision. Eventually, Marc took over maintaining the family property, always to Grandma's high standards, and now finds satisfaction in providing our communities with that same care. He hopes that the time his clients save when they call The Grass Man to do the dirty work will allow them to reconnect with family, shorten to-do lists and revisit the fun that comes with enjoying the outdoors. Give The Grass Man a call for a free, on site, estimate and then make a plan to get your summer back from chores and lost family time! 845-699-4539"
